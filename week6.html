   <p style="color:white">On the 6th rotation, we learnt about lamination, vacuum forming and molding and casting. Lamination is basically a technique that manufactures a product in multiple layers. I applied this porcess to make my own customized skaateboard.</p>

  <p style="color:white"> For the first assignment, I made my own skateboard using multiple layers of different kinds of wood, and then I could either make a sticker, spray paint or laser engrave my decoration. The first process is making the skateboard through a process called lamination. I glued multiple layers of different kinds of wood together. the challenge during this phase is to make sure that you aplly the sufficient amount of wood, which I barely managed to overcome./<p>
  <p style="color:white"> After all the pieces are glues together into one complete wood plank, I applied a technique called "Vacuum Forming" to create the curve on the skateboard.I put my board into a plastic bag, a piece of styrofoam and then vacuumed the bag. I let the bag rest for 24 hours and when I took it out, the tails of the board were curved. For the decoration, I spray painted the back of my skateboard. </p>

  <p style="color:white">For the second assignment, I made a chocolate mold using subtractive manufacturing, then I used that mold (which is made of plastic) to cast a silicon mold, which I eventually poured the chocolate in. First, I downloaded an image of a minion on Thingiverese. next, I used Meshmixer to cut the object in half. Then I used the CNC machine to make my plastic mold.
