  <p style="color:white">On the 9th rotation, we learnt about arduino. Arduino is a microcontroller that is used easily for electronics projects. We had two period to complete 15 challenges in the manual included in an Arduino Kit. In order for the circuit in the projects two work, we downloaded pre-written code from a website called "SparkFun", and downloaded the code into the microprocessor.</p>
