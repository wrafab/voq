  <p style="color:white">On the first rotation, we solved a number of challenges. The first one is constructing a structure that prevents the golf ball from touching the ground when dropped from 6ft. The second challenge is building the tallest tower from newspaper. We also learn about html and how to create a web page using GitHub.</p>
 <p style="color:white"> The name of the course "Digitial Engineering" has always interested me ever since I first saw it, as it indicates the implication modern technological devices in the learning process. I have always wanted to learn how to use machines such as the 3D printer to create things, and this course provides me with the opportunity to do so. The first week is quite interesting, as I am exposed to the concept of creating websites and how they work. I look forward to acquiring more captivating and mind-blowing knowledge later in this course.</p>
