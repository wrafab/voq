  <p style="color: white">On the second rotation, we learnt about CAD, or computer aiderd design. We learnt how to use Autodesk Fusion 360 to create different shapes, some of them were quite challenging to make.</p>

	<p style="color:white">At first, it was quite challenging ot create these shapes as it was difficult to correctly utilize all of the functions on Autodesk Dusion 360. One particular difficlties that I faced duinring the course of desinging the shapes was the "extrude" function. As these shapes consist of different parts, and each part has different depth, they require different value of extrusion. I could not figure out how to extrude each part differently, because as long as I extruded one part, the rest disappeared. When I finally discovered the solution, the designing process was much more quick and effective.</p>
